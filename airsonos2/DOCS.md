# AirSonos2 Home Assistant App

## Networking

AirSonos2 uses host networking. This is intentional: AirPlay discovery and Sonos control depend on LAN multicast and device-to-device HTTP traffic that is unreliable through ordinary bridged container networking.

## Configuration

The app exposes flat Home Assistant options and renders them to `/data/config.toml` before the bridge starts. Runtime-only values are forced for Home Assistant:

```toml
[server]
bind = "0.0.0.0"
http_port = 7000
state_dir = "/data"

[stream]
ffmpeg_path = "/usr/bin/ffmpeg"

[diagnostics]
metrics_addr = "0.0.0.0:9100"
```

Use `static_ips` when SSDP multicast does not reach every Sonos speaker. Use `include_rooms` and `exclude_rooms` to limit which visible Sonos rooms receive AirPlay endpoints.

`stream_codec` supports `mp3` and `wav`. MP3 is the compatibility default. WAV can reduce startup latency when your Sonos devices accept it.

`zone_offsets` accepts entries like:

```yaml
- zone: Kitchen
  offset_ms: 120
- zone: Office
  offset_ms: -40
```

The `zone` value should match the Sonos room name or zone id used by the bridge.

## Diagnostics

Enable `run_doctor_on_start` to run startup diagnostics without blocking bridge startup. You can also open the app terminal and run:

```bash
airsonos2 doctor --config /data/config.toml
```

The bridge serves:

```text
/healthz
/metrics
/test-tone.mp3
/streams/<session>
```
