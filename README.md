# AirSonos2

AirSonos2 is an experimental Rust service that exposes legacy Sonos S2 rooms as virtual AirPlay 2 speakers. It receives AirPlay PCM through `shairplay`, encodes a live MP3 stream with `ffmpeg`, serves that stream over HTTP, and controls Sonos playback through local UPnP/SOAP.

The primary target is a Linux LXC on Proxmox with flat-LAN-like multicast behavior between iOS devices, Sonos speakers, and the AirSonos2 host.

## Status

This repository contains the first working scaffold:

- Rust workspace with `core`, `airplay`, `sonos`, `stream`, `diagnostics`, and `cli` crates.
- `shairplay = "=0.5.0"` pinned with `ap2` and `resample` features.
- Sonos SSDP discovery, device XML parsing, zone topology parsing, and SOAP control actions.
- Live stream registry, chunked MP3 HTTP routes, generated `ffmpeg` test tone, and supervised per-session `ffmpeg` encoder wrapper.
- CLI commands: `serve`, `discover`, `doctor`, `pairings list`, `pairings reset --zone`, and `calibrate --zones`.
- Docker, systemd, Nix dev shell, and GitHub Actions check workflow.

Real-device AirPlay 2 and Sonos sync acceptance still must be validated on hardware. AirPlay 2 is reverse engineered and may break with iOS updates. Sync between bridged Sonos rooms is the main goal; sync with native HomePods or native AirPlay speakers remains experimental because Sonos adds a separate HTTP pull buffer after AirPlay timing.

## Sync

When you multi-select several AirSonos2 speakers from AirPlay, sessions that start within `[sync].multi_select_window_ms` are treated as one startup cohort. AirSonos2 prepares each Sonos stream first, waits until every stream is ready or `[sync].start_deadline_ms` expires, then dispatches the Sonos `Play` commands concurrently.

With `[sync].startup_compensation = true`, AirSonos2 keeps recent per-room startup timing samples for `SetAVTransportURI`, HTTP subscriber connection, first bytes served, and `Play` command completion. Once a room has at least `[sync].startup_min_samples`, its rolling median startup lag is compared with the slowest room in the cohort and faster rooms are delayed up to `[sync].startup_max_compensation_ms`.

For `stream.codec = "wav"`, cohorts also receive a shared future playback anchor with automatic compensation plus `[sync.zone_offsets_ms]` manual room offsets. MP3 remains supported, but sync is best-effort because it cannot use sample-aligned WAV anchors. The automatic measurement is stream-arrival timing, not acoustic output; use manual offsets, or microphone calibration outside the service, for residual speaker-specific output delay.

## Development

Use the Nix dev shell:

```bash
nix develop
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --all-features
docker build -f packaging/docker/Dockerfile .
```

One-shot checks:

```bash
nix develop -c cargo fmt --check
nix develop -c cargo check --workspace --all-features
nix develop -c cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings
nix develop -c cargo test --workspace --all-features
nix develop -c docker build -f packaging/docker/Dockerfile .
```

## Configuration

Start from [docs/config.example.toml](docs/config.example.toml).

```bash
install -d ~/.local/state/airsonos2
cargo run -p airsonos2-cli -- serve --config docs/config.example.toml
```

For Sonos rooms on another VLAN where SSDP multicast is not forwarded, set known speaker
addresses under `[sonos]`:

```toml
[sonos]
auto_discover = false
static_ips = ["192.168.20.10", "192.168.20.11"]
```

You can also leave `auto_discover = true` and use `static_ips` as extra discovery seeds.

The service creates one virtual AirPlay endpoint per included Sonos room. It persists virtual endpoint identity metadata under `state_dir/endpoints` and AirPlay 2 pairing keys under `state_dir/pairings`.

For normal AirPlay 2 pairing, keep `[airplay].pin` set to the HomeKit pairing PIN and leave `rtsp_password` unset. `rtsp_password` is only for legacy RTSP digest password authentication.

## Commands

```bash
airsonos2 discover --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
airsonos2 doctor --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
airsonos2 serve --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
airsonos2 pairings list --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
airsonos2 pairings reset --zone RINCON_000E58AAAAAA01400 --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
airsonos2 calibrate --zones Kitchen,Office,Den --config /etc/airsonos2/config.toml
```

`pairings list` prints each pairing store file and the number of stored client keys. `pairings reset --zone` removes `state_dir/pairings/<zone-id>.json`.

## Troubleshooting

For AirPlay connection debugging, stop any running service and run:

```bash
RUST_LOG=airsonos2=debug,airsonos2_airplay=debug,shairplay=debug \
  nix develop -c cargo run -p airsonos2-cli -- serve --config config.toml
```

Run `doctor` while `serve` is stopped when checking port availability. If `serve` is running, occupied ports such as `7020`, `5020`, `5021`, and later per-zone RTSP ports are expected. A recent local check showed `airsonos2` listening on `7020`, `5020`, and `5021`.

If an AirPlay client reports "failed to connect" and the logs show `Max connections reached` during AirPlay 2 setup, raise `[airplay].max_clients_per_zone`. AirPlay 2 can open multiple RTSP/event connections for one playback session, so the default is `10`.

For playback delay or pause/resume glitches, run with debug logging and confirm the bridge is keeping sessions alive across pause and flush:

```bash
RUST_LOG=airsonos2=debug,airsonos2_airplay=debug,shairplay=debug \
  nix develop -c cargo run -p airsonos2-cli -- serve --config config.toml
```

Expected behavior after a fix:

- `AP2 play pause` in shairplay logs is followed by `pausing Sonos playback` in airsonos2 logs.
- `AP2 play start` is followed by `resuming Sonos playback`.
- `AirPlay audio buffer flushed` should not be followed by `bridge session stopped`.
- `live MP3 stream ready; starting Sonos playback` should appear before the first Sonos `Play` for a new session.

Tune `[stream].prebuffer_ms` if startup still feels slow. Lower values start Sonos sooner once MP3 data is available; higher values wait longer for the encoder buffer (default `500` ms).
